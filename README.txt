A locally hosted web cataloging program. It can be used for inventorying your personal products. By supplying the information asked about the item in the Add page and providing a picture it gives you an easy visual way to see all of the items that you have. Inorder to use the program you will need to have a locally hosted (or remote) database to store the information. You need to fill out the connection details in each of the files. The database needs to have the following columns to work by default: ID(auto increment int), Name (varchar), Location (varchar), Type (varchar), Quantity (int), ISBN (bigint), Author (varchar), Img (varchar). You can change the column names if you want, but you must make sure to change the names in all of the files for the program to work. If you want to be able to use the Print Search to PDF function that the website has you must download TCPDF and put that folder into the Catalog folder. NOTE: The way the photos are set up, you have to save the photos that you want to use as a cover image to the photos folder within the catalog folder. You must also save the photos as a .jpg, if you want to change this it must be changed within the Add.php file. Also makesure that you name the photos the same way as you wrote when they were added so they show up on the home page.
